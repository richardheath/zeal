# Zeal Config Design

## name
Name of the package.

## description

## version
Package version.

## keep
Rule that zeal will use to determine if previously installed version needs 
to be uninstalled before installing new version of the package. 
If currently installed doesnâ€™t need to be uninstalled then multiple version will be installed on machine.

> ### major
>Uninstall current version if they have same major version. Otherwise
multi version can exist as long as they have different major version.

> ### minor
> Uninstall current version if they have same major.minor version.
Otherwise multi version can exist as long as they have different major.minor 
version.

> ### patch
> Default setting. Patch is considered the last section of the version number.
This disallows multi version and force only 1 version per instance.

> ### all
> Allow any version.

> ### pN
> Packages not following semver can specify the version position rule.

> ### {{settingsKey}}
> Uninstall current version if they have the same settingsKey value. Otherwise
multi version can exist as long as they have different settingsKey value.
This can be used for custom indicator like {{customer}} which allows multiple
version per target customer for multi tenant deployment strategy.
